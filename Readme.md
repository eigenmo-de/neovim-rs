Neovim preconfigured with Rust (Rustup)
=======================================

Use:
* `./build`  will build the container
* `./go` will run the container with the current working directory mapped as a volume

Suggestions:
* Symlink the `./go` file to somewhere like `/usr/bin` so that it is on the path

Includes:
* Neovim (incl init.vim)
* Rust (Rustup)
* RLS, RustFmt, etc
